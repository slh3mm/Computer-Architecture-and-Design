# Computer-Architecture-and-Design (UVA ECE 4435)

ECE4435&nbsp;(Computer Architecture and Design) Introduces computer architecture and provides a foundation for the design of complex synchronous digital devices, focusing on:
* Established approaches of computer architecture
* Techniques for managing complexity at the register transfer level
* Tools for digital hardware description, simulation, and synthesis.

Includes laboratory exercises and significant design activities using a hardware description language and simulation.
