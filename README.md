# Computer-Architecture-and-Design (UVA ECE 4435)

ECE4435&nbsp;(Computer Architecture and Design) Introduces computer architecture and provides a foundation for the design of complex synchronous digital devices, focusing on:
* Established approaches of computer architecture
* Techniques for managing complexity at the register transfer level
* Tools for digital hardware description, simulation, and synthesis.

This repository includes the contents of a semester-long project that revolved around building a Basic RISC CPU in VHDL using Intel Quartus.

A list of the Learning Activities can be seen below.
* LA 1: Program Counter & Instruction Register
* LA 2: Register File
* LA 3: ALU
* LA 4: Control Signals Logic
* LA 5: Sequencer & Shift Control
* LA 6: CPU Verification
* LA 7: XOR Implementation
